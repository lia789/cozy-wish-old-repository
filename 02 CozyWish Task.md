## Solo Developer Guidelines

As a solo developer with limited budget and time, follow these guidelines:

### Development Priorities
1. **Focus on MVP First**: Prioritize the minimum viable product features that deliver core value to users.
2. **Iterative Development**: Build in small, testable increments rather than attempting large feature sets at once.
3. **Technical Debt Management**: Document technical compromises made for speed, and plan to address them in future iterations.
4. **Automate Testing**: Invest time in automated tests for critical functionality to save debugging time later.
5. **Use Existing Solutions**: Leverage third-party libraries, APIs, and SaaS tools instead of building everything from scratch.

### Notes
- Update README.md file with user manual, easy to maintain for future and daily day-to-day task cheat sheet
- Every feature should have unit and integration testing, later manual smoke testing will be performed
- Ask questions before starting implementation about core features
